# 概述 #
[The Art of Community](http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/2009/09/18/the-art-of-community-now-available-for-free-download/) by Jono Bacon is one of those seminal books on community building in the digital age. It has been translated into a couple languages since publication, but the Chinese edition has yet to come out. We think we can't wait for that, so we decided we shall crowdsource the translation from people who are passionate about this. Thus we built this project to facilitate the translation.
